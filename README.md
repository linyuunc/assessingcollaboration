## General principal of evaluation 
1. It begins with educational values.  
2. good assessment recognizes learning as multi-dimensional, integrated and revealed in performance over time.   
3. Assessment works best when the object to be assessed has clear, explicitly stated purposes.   
4. Good assessment is ongoing, and not episodic. 
## Important decisions in grading collaborative work 

### 1. Whether to assess group product or group process
* product: pictures show evaluating onling discussion, and a course project
* Process (STILL DEVELOPING)

### 2. Deciding who does the evaluating 
* **Instructor**
two ways: 
 1)contract grading. Students and instructors develop a written contract that specifies tasks that students do to achieve different grade levels. 
 2) competency-based. includes mastry, performance-based, and criterion-referenced systems. 
 3) assign a grade based on amount of improvement a student has made in the class. Avoids competition and emphasizes individual learning
 
* **Student self-evaluation**

* **Student Peer Evaluation**    
used to assess group process at the group and individual levels 
teachers also use it for content (calibrated peer reviews)  
faculty need to devote time to instructing students on how to effectively assess the product or presentation

### 5. Group Individuals and Groups (three models)
* Model 1: Assign Individual Grades
(This might minimize the importance of group effort)
* Model 2: Assign Group grades 
(Assign a collectivey earned grade to each member. 
Drawback: Individuals are not held accountable. Kagan 1995 thinks group grades is unfair and unwise because of five reasons.)

* Model 3:the combination of individual and group grades 
(75% individual and 25% group grade for high-stakes assignment)
(25% individual and 75% group grade for low-stakes assignment)

## Conclusion: There's a natural tension between collaborative learning goals and having an instructor assign a final grade.
