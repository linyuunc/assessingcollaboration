# Assessing Collaboration (mainly retrieved from BMC,2014)
## General principal of evaluation 
1. It begins with educational values.  
2. good assessment recognizes learning as multi-dimensional, integrated and revealed in performance over time.   
3. Assessment works best when the object to be assessed has clear, explicitly stated purposes.   
4. Good assessment is ongoing, and not episodic. 
## Important decisions in grading collaborative work 

### 1. Whether to assess group product or group process
* product: pictures show evaluating onling discussion, and a course project
* Process (STILL DEVELOPING)

### 2. Deciding who does the evaluating 
* **Instructor**
two ways: 
 1)contract grading. Students and instructors develop a written contract that specifies tasks that students do to achieve different grade levels. 
 2) competency-based. includes mastry, performance-based, and criterion-referenced systems. 
 3) assign a grade based on amount of improvement a student has made in the class. Avoids competition and emphasizes individual learning
 
* **Student self-evaluation**

* **Student Peer Evaluation**    
used to assess group process at the group and individual levels 
teachers also use it for content (calibrated peer reviews)  
faculty need to devote time to instructing students on how to effectively assess the product or presentation

* **Group Evaluation

### 3. Decide wheter to evaluate for formative or summative purposes 

### 4. General guidelines for grading collaborative work

### 5. Group Individuals and Groups (three models)
* Model 1: Assign Individual Grades
(This might minimize the importance of group effort)
* Model 2: Assign Group grades 
(Assign a collectivey earned grade to each member. 
Drawback: Individuals are not held accountable. Kagan 1995 thinks group grades is unfair and unwise because of five reasons.)

* Model 3:the combination of individual and group grades 
(75% individual and 25% group grade for high-stakes assignment)
(25% individual and 75% group grade for low-stakes assignment)

CoLT20: Group grades
CoLT: Dialogue journals 

## Conclusion: There's a natural tension between collaborative learning goals and having an instructor assign a final grade. 

Grading in the online classroom.

**Linyu reflections**: 
1. There are still a lot that need to be done for assessing the collaboration process. (Starting from foreign language tele-communication process might be a good starting point)   
2. Individuals are held accountable for high-stake assignment, which in a way undermines the importance of collabroation.
